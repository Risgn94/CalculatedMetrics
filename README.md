# CalculatedMetrics
This is a simple example of how the Google Analytics Core reporting API can be used to create alerts on calculated metrics.

## Step-by-step Guide
First of all, you need to follow the first two steps here: https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/core/v4/quickstart/installed-py

Next, you are able to import this code, where you need to implement your client_secrets.json file.

Then, you need to pick a view id for which you want the call associated. This can easily be extended to concern more than one account.

Please contact me with bugs and errors.
